# A-B-Testing-on-Newsletter-Conversion-Rates
The goal is to identify which newsletter variant has the higher conversion rate and determine if the observed difference is statistically significant.

✉️ A/B Testing Analysis for Newsletter Conversion Rates ✉️

🔎 Overview
This project delves into the statistical analysis of A/B testing data 📈 for newsletter conversion rates. A/B testing, or split testing 🧪, is the science of comparing two versions of a webpage, email, or other marketing asset by altering a single variable (like subject line, content, images 🖼️) to discover which variant garners a higher conversion rate.

📚 Dataset
Our dataset is a collection of conversion rates for two distinct newsletters 📰: Conversion_A and Conversion_B. Each entry represents a conversion rate observed from different recipients 🧑‍🤝‍🧑.

🎯 Objective
The mission is clear: to deduce which newsletter variant—A or B—boasts a higher conversion rate and to verify the statistical significance ✅ of this observed difference.

🔬 Methodology

Data Visualization: We employ histograms with Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) 📊 to visualize and compare the distribution of conversion rates for both newsletter variants.
Hypothesis Testing: A two-sample t-test 📉 is conducted to rigorously evaluate the difference in means between the two independent samples.

📝 Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis (H0): Newsletter A's mean conversion rate is equal to or greater than Newsletter B's 🆚.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Newsletter A's mean conversion rate is less than that of Newsletter B 🔽.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python 🐍 is our chosen instrument, with a suite of libraries at our disposal—pandas, numpy, seaborn, scipy, and matplotlib—to conduct data analysis and hypothesis testing.

📊 Results
The t-test speaks: a statistically significant difference in conversion rates is uncovered, leading us to reject the null hypothesis 🚫. The evidence indicates that Newsletter B outshines Newsletter A in terms of conversion rate 📈.

📢 Recommendations
With the data narrative concluded, the recommendation is to bestow the mantle to Newsletter B for forthcoming campaigns 🏹. This strategic shift is poised to potentially elevate conversion rates and lead us to greater heights 🚀.
